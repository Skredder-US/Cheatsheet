# Cheatsheet
Open-ended final project of Web Development Fundamentals. I decided to make a simplified version of Codecademy's cheatsheet. 

navbar
---
My first big commit. I decided to tackle the nav bar first. The static comparison is pretty close between mine and Codecademy's but not all the dynamic functionality is there. They used svg instead of img and that allowed for pictures to turn colors on hover, only my text turns purplish on hover. Also svg allows for background-color and border to change on hover. Svg looks too complicated for the scope of my project so I settled for images. 

My biggest challenge was working outside of Codecademy's workspaces editor -- I couldn't get fonts to work in their editor and wanted the fonts to match of course! Next was vertically aligning the list items, I thought margin:auto would work and might try again but had to settle with a solution I found on the web, display: flex. 

The code is getting big and I'm nervous I'll need to rework previous work to make new work function. 

header

Smaller commit but still a good portion of the total work. I think they are using percentages to get fractions of pixels so my site doesn't match exactly. Also, I'm only matching the site to their's, fullscreen on my laptop. their's is really nice and fancy when the screen resizes but at least mine is close at fullscreen -- I haven't learned how to adapt to screensize yet. I also think their font looks nicer for some reason, like it's anti-aliased. 

My biggest challenge (funnily enough) was using Snip and Sketch to grab images of their icons (touchpad worked really well though.) My icon images look close enough to their svg icons for practical purposes. 

This commit includes small changes to the navbar, not much though. 

(just noticed I forgot dynamic functionality like :hover so I'm going to go back and complete that)

topics nav
---
This nav is the closest to original website, so much that I kind of want to make the previous sections more precise! Overall I'm getting fooled which website I'm on, switching back and forth shows small jumps in location but they really do look similar. 

My biggest challenge was adding the border-left to the topic list item that signified the current location! I started with padding on the nav element but later found I needed a border to touch the side of the nav. I needed to think through the process of implementing each element before starting the first one, I'll try that next time! 

table
---
My final addition! I used a table instead of whatever they were doing with divs called "layout grid". I decided this was enough work and close enough for learning purposes. I want to redo this whole assignment because I found it a valueable learning experience! I will tackle it differently and try to get even more precise! 

My biggest challenge was using a table and getting the spacing correct. 

final thoughts
---
I figure they used some method of procedural generation with a resizing layout to handle all cheatsheet pages and device sizes, I used manual input and a single size to match my webpage to theirs. I enjoyed this assignment and found it educational. I will reattempt this assignment, maybe I'll learn even more!
